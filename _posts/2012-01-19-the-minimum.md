## About the \_minimum

- Love minimalism? So do I. I've put some effort on typography(not the type face) so your reader won't need Readability to read your content.
- Design is simple so is the code behind it. You can easily customize it.
- Built with mobile first.
- Written with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) so if you need to edit it, you should get [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/). I did use this app to develop this theme.

## About me

I'm Yuya Saito who is a web designer/front-end developer from Tokyo, Japan.

This is a Jekyll Bootstrap port of my theme [studiomohawk/jekyll-theme-the_minimum](https://github.com/studiomohawk/jekyll-theme-the_minimum).
If you watch or fork from it, you should do those here instead.
