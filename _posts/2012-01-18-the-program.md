## About the \_program

the \program is designed for documentaion in mind. If you have open source
project in your hand, it's always good idea to have a good documentation for
it.

- Design is simple so is the code behind it. You can easily customize it.
- Built with mobile first.
- Written with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) so if you need to edit it, you should get [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/). I did use this app to develop this theme.

## About me

I'm Yuya Saito who is a web designer/front-end developer from Tokyo, Japan.

This is a Jekyll Bootstrap port of my theme [studiomohawk/jekyll-theme-the_minimum](https://github.com/studiomohawk/jekyll-theme-the_minimum).
If you watch or fork from it, you should do those here instead.
